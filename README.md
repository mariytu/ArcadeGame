# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## How to run the app?

Download or clone the repository from Github:

```

Well, no you are ready!! baa!! obvious, you need a browser... that up to you.. So, choose your preferred browser and open `index.html` in a browser and start to play!!

## About the game

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

During the game all the movements made will be counted... Every 15 movements you lose a life.. I'm sorry, but that's life = (

When you get to the water, you win and you can play again with all your stars =)
